1. ABOUT
I made this mod as an attempt to automate the "Zombies" gametype we used to play on Ps||Clanserver. It required the admins to be around and be completely in control of the game, making sure when players died they switched to the right teams, etc. This replaces that and makes it so that the admins just change to a new gametype ("zom") and the mod does the rest!

To start, install the mod on your server. Then do "/rcon g_gametype zom" followed by "/rcon map_restart" or change to a new map.

That's it! Simple, eh?




2. FEATURES
	- Classic Zombies vs. Hunters
	- Zombies are Russian, Hunters are German
	- Random Zombie is picked at the beginning, otherwise last Hunter from the previous 
	  round is the first Zombie
	- Hunters can't shoot while there is only one Zombie
	- Zombies can't shoot, they must bash
	- Zombie perks such as "Mega jump", "super speed", and "poison"
	- Hunters are allowed MG's
	- No MG42's
	- HUD stats
	- "Game Cam" at the end of the game
	- Best Zombie, Hunter, most kills, bashes and headshots at the end of the game
	- Freaking intense fog
	- Darkness!
	- Last Hunter at the end of the game becomes a "super hunter" and wields
	  a Thompson and a Panzerfaust
	- NO DOWNLOADING! :D
	- Complete gametype, works with other mods.
